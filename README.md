This project is a real-time mobile phone detection system built with Python, OpenCV, and YOLOv8.

The system processes video input and detects mobile phones using a pre-trained YOLOv8 model. When a phone is detected, a bounding box and label are displayed on the screen, and an audio alarm is triggered using multithreading to avoid blocking video processing.

This solution can be applied in industrial environments, schools, examination rooms, security monitoring, and workplace compliance systems.
